# Meet out Dragons

Meet our dragons is a frontend test for the company SoftDesign. The main function is to create and list ~edit and delete~ the dragons. 

## Installation

```bash
npm install
```

## Usage

```bash
npm start
```

## Note
I don't have the delete and edit function yet. As soon as I create the functions, they will be in the dev branch. :)

#### Thank you!
